# irishArtProject

The Irish Art Project aims to create a collection of the Artworks dotted around Irish towns and cities.

These Artworks can vary from murals, sculptures, street art and graffiti.

Users can log in and view the Artworks which have been tagged across their locations with details including location, artist name and a description of the Artwork.

The long term goal would be for users to be updated on the latest Artworks added in a location and also that users can add location and details for wider Art services.

These wider services could include Art museums, exhibitions, and Art classes and their details.
